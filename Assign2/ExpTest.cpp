//Create a program ExpTest.cpp that computes and prints out the values of the k-term Taylor series approximation to ex for k = 1 to N, where N is input. The terms in the sum will be accumulated using a variable of type double. Your output should also print out the value of ex returned by the standard library routine std::exp(x) as well as the absolute difference between the values of the Taylor series approximation and std::exp(x). This program will repeat the computation multiple times with the computation being done using different types to accumulate the product that's required to obtain k!. Specifically, the program should compute and print out the results when k! is accumulated with a variable of

//type int
//type unsigned int
//type double
//By observing the output of your program, for each data type determine the maximal value of k (for k â‰¤ 30) for which the Taylor series approximation of ex is reasonable for the value at x=1.0. Place the results of your observation in Assign2results.txt.

//My overall approach is to:
//1. Calculate accurate exp(x)
//2. Calculate approximate using Taylors in integer
//  a. Compute factorial N!
//  b. Compute x^k/N! and sum it up as it computes
//  c. Compute difference between accurate exp(x) and approximate with Taylors
//3. Repeat step 2 with unsigned integer and double
