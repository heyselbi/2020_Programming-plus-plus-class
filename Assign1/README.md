[C0] Install the IDE you intend to use for this course (if it's not already installed).

Microsoft : Visual Studio Community Edition 2019. A search for "Visual Studio Community Edition" lead to the link

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Be sure to install the C++ development environment for Desktop applications. (The Visual Studio Community Edition for the Mac does not provide support for C++ programming.)

Linux : Install g++ compiler. Eclipse with the CDT (C/C++) development environment.

MacOS: Xcode
[C1] Using the IDE of your choice, create a Solution/Workspace and an "empty" first project. The Solution/Workspace should be associated with a directory for the course assignments, and your first project should be associated with a sub-directory of the Solutions/Workspace directory. After you've set up your Solution/Workspace and first project, you should have a directory structure such as

      Your_Math_280_Directory
      ================
       |                                           
      Assign1                              

For those using Microsoft Visual Studio, instructions for this task are available from https://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/UsingVCPP_2019/index.html
[C2] Download Assign1.cpp and add it to your first project, build the project, and run the program.

[C3] Add an empty second project to your Solution/Workspace that will be used for your second assignment. Verify that when you've done this that your directory structure has the form

      Your_Math_280_Directory
============================================
    |           |                                 
Assign1      Assign2   ***    
                        
[C4] Copy and paste the following questions to a plain text file, and then write your answers below the questions (You will be submitting this plain text file).

[1] Give the full path name of the executable you created for Assign1.cpp.


[2] Give the full path name of the file that is included by the statement "#include <iostream>". 


[3] If you put a file in your project directory, does it automatically included in your project? 


[4] If you delete/remove your project, does it delete all the files associated with the project? 


[5] What happens with respect to building the executable from Assign1.cpp, if you remove the line "using namespace std;" in Assign1.cpp? 
What you should turn in.
Submit on the course web site your answers to [C4] as a plain text file.
